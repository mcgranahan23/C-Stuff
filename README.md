Menu Option One:
Prompt a user to input the item, or word, they wish to look for.
Return a numeric value for the frequency of the specific word.

Menu Option Two:
Print the list with numbers that represent the frequency of all items purchased.
The screen output should include every item (represented by a word) paired with the number of times that item appears in the input file, CS210_Project_Three_Input_File.txt. For example, the file might read as follows:
Potatoes 4
Pumpkins 5
Onions 3

Menu Option Three:
Print the same frequency information for all the items in the form of a histogram.
Then print the name, followed by asterisks or another special character to represent the numeric amount.
The number of asterisks should equal the frequency read from the CS210_Project_Three_Input_File.txt
file. For example, if the file includes 4 potatoes, 5 pumpkins, and 3 onions,
then your text-based histogram may appear as represented below. However, you can alter the
appearance or color of the histogram in any way you choose:
Potatoes ****
Pumpkins *****
Onions ***

Menu Option Four:
Exit the program.

Data File Creation:
Create a data file, with the naming convention frequency.dat, for backing up your accumulated data.
The frequency.dat file should include every item (represented by a word) paired with the number
of times that item appears in the input file.

This output file is created in the beginning of the program without user intervention and is
for backup purposes. For assistance with writing files, see sections 7.1, "File Input," and 7.3,
"File Output," in zyBooks.

For this assignment, your implementation plan must include at least one class with public and
private sections. For assistance with classes, see sections 6.2, "Using a Class," and 6.3,
"Defining a Class," in zyBooks.
For this assignment, we recommend using Maps (section 11.4 in zyBooks) for implementation.
Maps do require precise coding syntax. However, you can choose a different implementation option.
